        <h1>Welcome to Unofficial Website of IPL</h1>
        <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most celebrated and widely watched cricket tournaments in the
            world. Launched in 2008 by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the IPL has transformed cricket
            into a high-octane sport that blends entertainment with the spirit of competition.
        </p>
        <h1>History and Evolution</h1>
        <p>The IPL was conceived as a franchise-based Twenty20 (T20) cricket league, featuring teams representing
            various cities in India. The tournament quickly gained popularity, attracting top cricketing talents from
            around the globe. The leagueâ€™s unique format, where teams bid for players in a high-profile auction, has
            made it a lucrative platform for cricketers and a source of endless excitement for fans.</p>
        <h1>Foundation</h1>
        <p>On 13 September 2007, following India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup, the BCCI announced the launch of
            the Indian Premier League (IPL), a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition. The inaugural season was
            scheduled for April 2008, starting with a ceremony in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the
            IPL initiative, outlined the tournament's format, prize money, and squad composition rules. The league would
            also serve as a qualifying mechanism for that year's Champions League Twenty20.
        </p>
        <p>To determine team ownership, an auction for the franchises was held on 24 January 2008. Although the reserve
            prices for the eight franchises totaled $400 million, the auction ultimately raised $723.59 million. The
            league officially commenced in April 2008, featuring teams like Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Mumbai Indians
            (MI), Delhi Daredevils (DD), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), Deccan Chargers (DC), Rajasthan Royals (RR), Kolkata
            Knight Riders (KKR), and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).Royal Challengers Bangalore has never got any
            suspension or any ban we love this team so much that even havent allowed them to win any IPL trophy in these
            16 years. Also we dont have any future plans to let them win. So the final verdict is that until Jay Shah
            leaves the country permanently RCB wont win win Cup, enjoy RCBians.</p>
        <h1>Expansions and Terminations</h1>
        <p>Before the fourth season in 2011, Pune Warriors India and Kochi Tuskers Kerala joined the IPL. The Pune
            franchise was purchased by the Sahara Adventure Sports Group for $370 million, while Rendezvous Sports World
            acquired the Kochi franchise for $333.3 million. IPL is full of colours but I dont know why I made this
            website in black-grey-white theme, to be honest I know the reason but I dont want to share. However, Kochi
            was terminated after one season due to non-payment of the franchise fee. In September 2012, the Deccan
            Chargers franchise was terminated, and in October, Sun TV Network won the bid for the replacement franchise,
            which became Sunrisers Hyderabad.</p>
        <p>Pune Warriors India withdrew from the IPL in May 2013 due to financial disputes with the BCCI, leading to
            their termination in October. In June 2015, Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were suspended for two
            seasons following a spot-fixing and betting scandal, with new franchises from Pune and Rajkot replacing them
            temporarily.</p>
        <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 season was held in the United Arab Emirates. In August 2021, the BCCI
            announced the addition of two new franchises for the 2022 season, which were won by RPSG Group and CVC
            Capital. These teams were named Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans.</p>
        <p>Several IPL franchise owners have expanded their presence by acquiring teams in other leagues like the
            Caribbean Premier League, South Africa's SA20, the UAE's International League T20, and the USA's Major
            League Cricket, branding them similarly to their IPL franchises.</p>
