        <h1>Welcome to Unofficial Website of IPL</h1>
        <p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most celebrated and widely watched cricket tournaments in the
            world. Launched in 2008 by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the IPL has transformed cricket
            into a high-octane sport that blends entertainment with the spirit of competition.</p>
        <h1>History and Evolution</h1>
        <p>The IPL was conceived as a franchise-based Twenty20 (T20) cricket league, featuring teams representing
            various cities in India. The tournament quickly gained popularity, attracting top cricketing talents from
            around the globe. The leagueâ€™s unique format, where teams bid for players in a high-profile auction, has made
            it a lucrative platform for cricketers and a source of endless excitement for fans.</p>
        <h1>Foundation</h1>
        <p>On 13 September 2007, following India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup, the BCCI announced the launch of
            the Indian Premier League (IPL), a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition. The inaugural season was
            scheduled for April 2008, starting with a ceremony in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the
            IPL initiative, outlined the tournament's format, prize money, and squad composition rules.</p>

        <h1>Expansions and Terminations</h1>
        <p>Before the fourth season in 2011, Pune Warriors India and Kochi Tuskers Kerala joined the IPL. The Pune
            franchise was purchased by the Sahara Adventure Sports Group for $370 million, while Rendezvous Sports World
            acquired the Kochi franchise for $333.3 million. Kochi was terminated after one season due to non-payment of
            the franchise fee.</p>
